Format of a three-dimensional event matrix c
====================================================

c.shape = (N_events, 4)
c[i,:] = [t_i,x_i,y_i,p_i]

All numbers are floating point:
t_i - event timestamp in seconds
x_i - event horizontal pixel coordinate
y_i - event vertical pixel coordinate
p_i - event polarity; 0 (negative) or 1 (positive)
